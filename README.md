### How to use
- Enter Alpaca API/account info and desired trading amounts into config.py.
- Manipulate strategy data to match your needs.
- Run main.py and use tools from account_info to guide further analysis.
- Note:
  - Trade_executor in this version uses the function that makes one trade at a time (for testing purposes), switch functions if you want to run real-time trading once everything is set up correctly.
